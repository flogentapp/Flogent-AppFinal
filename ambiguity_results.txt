Hint: Try changing 'profiles' to one of the following: 'profiles!fk_planner_assignee', 'profiles!fk_planner_creator', 'profiles!fk_planner_deleter', 'profiles!planner_tasks_assigned_to_id_fkey', 'profiles!planner_tasks_created_by_fkey', 'profiles!planner_tasks_marked_done_by_id_fkey'. Find the desired relationship in the 'details' key.
